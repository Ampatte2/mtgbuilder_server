#MTGbuilder_server

This is a project that uses MySQL, React frontend, with Node/Express Backend to allow users to search for Magic The Gathering Cards

Users can create a profile and add cards to their database. They can also create decklists that specify number of cards and clone decks from other users to edit to make their own.

The search functionality uses Magicthegathering api to search for five different specifications returning information about the card. If the card does not have an image as with newer cards a standard MTG card back is displayed.

The site supports drag and drop functionality.
